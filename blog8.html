        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Vulnerabilities
            associated with cookiess</h2>
        <p class="grey">Last Updated: November 13, 2020 </p>
        <img src="images/blog8.png">
        <p> In last week's blog post, I debunked some myths 
        about the HTTP cookies and proved them false. If most people who utilize cookies
        have good intentions, then why do they often have a bad reputation?
        </p>
        <p> In this week's blog, I am going to talk about certain examples of
        vulnerabilities associated with cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>Man-in-the-middle</h3>
        <p> According to Harshal Patil in his <a href="https://blog.webf.zone/ultimate-guide-to-http-cookies-2aa3e083dbae">"Ultimate Guide to HTTP Cookies"</a>
        blog, people mistakenly attribute data stealing to cookies because of the man-in-the-middle 
        attack. In fact, this attack has little to do with cookies but more so with HTTP and HTTPS.
        The middle entities simply read the cookies, so if a data stored in cookies travels via HTTP 
        and are read by the hacker, then the hacker can fake as another user. 
        </p>
        <h3>How to protect yourself from a MID attack?</h3>
        <p>In order to protect yourself from this type of attack, you can do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure “HTTPS” — with the S — is always in the URL bar of the websites you visit. With 
                HTTPS, man-in-the-middle attack is less likely to happen. 
            </li>
            <li>Be on the lookout for any suspicious or phising emails from attackers
                asking you to update your login credentials such as updating your password.
            </li>
            <li> According to Norton Security, you should also make sure your home Wi-Fi network is
                secure.
            </li>
            <li>Do not connect to public Wi-Fi routers directly, if possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery</h3>
        <p> Another attack that utilizes cookies is called Cross Site Request Forgery. This is an attack where
            the attacker tricks the user's computer into running code that is perceived as trustworthy due to
            the fact that it appears to belong to the server; this allows the attacker to 
            obtain a copy of the cookie or perform other operations.
            According to Harshal Patil, in this scenario the attacker simply exploits the fact that cookies 
            are sent to server for each and every request.</p> 
            <p> To understand this better, Harshap Patil gives an example scenario and asks us to imagine that a user is visiting two websites: 
            one is a legitimate bank 
            website and the other one is some fake website created by the attacker. Assuming the user has already logged into bank website
            and is trying to navigate to the attacker's website, it will try to load image at given address. 
            As a result, the browser could send the cookie for that domain, even if the request is issued from some other website (cross-site).
            Harshap Patil says: "In short, evil website made a cross-site request to other domain with an intention to cause harm. Such attack is known as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
            CSRF attacks happen very silently and involves visiting multiple website at once; thus it is very difficult to track down CSRF attach."</p>
        <h3>How to protect against CSRF?</h3>
        <p> According to Harshal Patil, a simple solution to CSRF attack is to use Referer Header.
            Referrer header tells server from where the request has originate. In his example, mybank.com server can 
            check Referer header. If the request is coming from evilwebsite.com, then Referer header will contain that 
            value and server can simply reject that request. </p>
        <p>In conclusion, although cookies are often a topic of a debate and may carry a bad reputation, 
        you can be assured cookies are designed with good intentions. 
        With good measures cookies can help build strong session management experience for your web applications 
        without compromising on security. If you are still feel uneasy about them then take the right 
        measures and precaution any attacks on the web in general.
        </p>

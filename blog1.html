    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Web Accessibility: Screen Reader</h2>
    <p class="grey">Last Updated: September 10, 2020 </p>

    <p> I have never heard about screen readers until I watched the Youtube video - "Using Screen Readers"  - posted by TheDOITCenter 
        channel. According to the video, a screen reader is a screen reading software that converts everything on the screen into 
        a synthesized speech to convey the information on the screen to the user. In order to access the content on websites, people with 
        impaired vision often rely on accessible technologies like screen readers. According to the article <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/why-screen-readers-are
        -essential-for-website-accessibility" style="color: black">"Why Screen Readers Are Essential for Website Accessibility"</a> by Bureau 
        of Internet Accessibility, almost 7.3 million people in the United States have some form of visual disability.

        In this video, Hadi Rangin - an accessibility expert and a member of the IT Accessibility Team at the University of Washington -
        demonstrates the difference between an accessible page and inaccesible page. In contrast to an accessible webpage, 
        when navigating through an inaccesible webpage the users of screen readers cannot identify what are the major components of the website 
        causing them to practially read the whole webpage from top to bottom. An accessible website give the screen reader users an advantage
        to navigate around the website quickly and find the most important information. 
    </p>
    <p> This video has made me realize how diverse an audience for a web page can be and has broadened my 
        knowledge about the importance of using correct HTML elements to create good semantic structures. Prior to watching the video,
        I only thought about the semantic struture as a way for a web developer to keep their code organized. It has not crossed my mind how a good 
        semantic structure can open up opportunities for making my website more accessible and inclusive to different audiences. 
    </p>   
    
    <p> As a matter of fact, I have tried my best to develop the HTML code for this blog with accessibility in mind by following
        good practices for imposing a clear semantic structure. </p>

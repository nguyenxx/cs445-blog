        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">React for Dummies: Fundamentals</h2>
        <p class="grey">Last Updated: October 29, 2020 </p>
        <p>In preparation for the React App project, in addition to watching
            the lecture videos, I decided to read some articles and summarize the fundamental
            React.js concepts, I've learned so far.
        </p>
        <h3>Components, Props, States</h3>
        <p>According to the article <a href="https://medium.com/@kellyharrop/react-for-dummies-c56a94063bfe" target="_blank">"React for Dummies" </a>
        by Kelly Harrop, <b>components</b> are the building blocks of your React app. You form bigger components
        by putting together smaller components. According to the article 
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-the-fundamental-react-js-concepts-jammed-into-this-single-medium-article-c83f9b53eac2/?ref=hackernoon.com" target="_blank">All the fundamental React.js concepts, jammed into this one article</a>
        by Samer Buna, a component name starts with a capital letter since lowercase case names are 
        reserved for HTML elements. The ReactDOM will ignore the functioin, if that is the case.</p>
        <p>
        Just like HTML elements, every component in React has a list of attributes, often referred to as
        <b>props</b> - the data that came from the parent to the child. On the other hand, if the data that is
        owned and managed by the child that is called a <b>state</b>.
        In our lecture, we created a Swatch component for 
        our Pal app in the swatch.js file. We added to our Swatch function a parameter props,
        which is an object of all the data that gets sent. In our case, we recieved a color object (props.color).
        </p>
        <h3>JSX</h3>
        <p>According to the document <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react/" target="_blank">React Fundamentals</a> by React Native,
        <b>JSX</b> is a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript. If you want to write a JavaScript expression inside
        a JSX section, you will need to use that expression inside the curly braces to make it work. You can also use the
        self-closing form of the tag, if there are no children. Kelly Harrop describes JSX as something that "looks like HTML
        in your JS file". Kelly says the most obvious difference is the use of className insread of class
        when defining your elements. The use of the JSX syntax has also been
        demonstrated in our lecture video.
        </p>
        <h3>Events in React</h3>
        <p> According to a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html">React</a> document, there are two significant differences 
            from the way we handle events inside React elements vs. with the DOM API: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, all React element attributes are names using <b>camelCase</b>
                    rather than <b>lowercase</b>.</li>
                <li>Secondly, JavaScript function reference is passed as the <b>event handler</b>,
                    rather than a <b>string</b>
                </li> 
            </ul>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>HTML vs. React</b></p>
                <pre>
                    &lt;button onclick="activateLasers()"&gt;
                    Activate Lasers
                    &lt;/button&gt;
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    &lt;button onclick={activateLasers}&gt;
                    Activate Lasers
                    &lt;/button&gt;
                </pre>
           
        <p>
        Another difference that the document notes is that you cannot 
        return false to prevent default behavior in React. 
        You must call preventDefault explicitly.
        </p>

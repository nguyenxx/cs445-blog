        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">CSS Grid vs. Flexbox</h2>
        <p class="grey">Last Updated: September 17, 2020 </p>
        <p> This week in CS347 course, I have been learning about the different uses and properties of Flexbox. In
            class, we examined how Flexbox can be
            utilized to help us with the distribution and alignment of children elements in a parent element, the sizing
            of those elements as well as
            their expansion using a relational weight system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last year in my SMAD307: Interactive Design For Web I course, I learned about another layout system called
            CSS Grid. With my knowledge
            about both types of layout systems, Flexbox layout and CSS Grid layout, I want to explore their proper uses
            and
            find out what kind of scenarios would fit the best for each system.
        </p>
        <p> After, doing some research by reading different articles and watching YouTube videos on this topic, I have
            identified
            the following main points about the differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox. </p>
        <h2>The main differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox</h2>
        <p>According to Chris Coyier's article <a
                href="https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/" target="_blank">
                "Quick! Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Flexbox and Grid?"</a>, Flexbox is considered a one-dimensional
            layout system, whereas CSS Grid
            is two-dimensional. Even though we can make rows and columns in flexbox as it allows elements to wrap, but
            there is
            no way to declare the positioning of the elements since they are just pushed a long a single axis. In
            contrast,
            with CSS Grid, we can explicitly declare the sizing of rows and columns as we choose since it is
            two-dimensional. </p>
        <p>Another difference between these two layouts is that CSS Grid is mostly defined on the parent element,
            whereas Flexbox layout often happens on the children elements. </p>
        <h2>When should we use CSS Grid vs. Flexbox?</h2>
        <p> Based on the differences described previously, we can conclude that CSS grid is better for layout and
            Flexbox
            is often better for alignment.</p>
        <p> Here is a list of different situations I have found in LogRocket blog post <a
                href="https://blog.logrocket.com/flexbox-vs-css-grid/" target="_blank">"When to use Flexbox and when to
                use CSS grid"</a>, when
            Flexbox layout works out better than CSS Grid and vice versa.</p>
        <h2>Flexbox is better for:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Content-first design</li>
            <li>Aligning items</li>
            <li>Small design implementations</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Grid CSS is better for:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Layout-first design</li>
            <li>Overlapping elements</li>
            <li>Complex design implementations</li>
            <li>Creating a gap between block elements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After learning about these differences between CSS Grid and Flexbox, I am now more confident about utilizing
            both of these layouts to build a Handcrafted Site for my first project in CS347. I am planning to use CSS
            Grid
            to build different layouts for my four site pages and utilize Flexbox to create a photo gallery for my
            Photos page.

        <p class="grey">Last Updated: September 17, 2020 </p>
        <p> In preparation for Project 1: Handcradted Site project for CS347,
            I decided to revisit things I have learned about user interface designs and remind myself
            about some core design concepts. I would like to share my thoughts on some examples
            of user interfaces I would consider as a bad design, "Hall of Shame" and a good design,
            "Hall of Fame".
        </p>

        <h2>Hall of Shame</h2>

        <p> I have chosen CodingBat, a free site of live coding problems to build coding skill in Java and Python,
            as an example of a user interface design that lacks in some core design concepts such as visibility and
            consistency. At a glance, it it is hard to tell where is the main navigation. However, if you look closely
            the main navigation is located in the upper right corner next to the login area. According to the design
            principles, important functions such as the main navigation menu should be one of the most visible
            components
            of the website. The navigation menu should be consistent throughout the the website as the user switches
            from
            one page to another. However, when switched to one of the learning pages, certain components of the
            navigation
            menu (code help + videos, done, prefs) are not available anymore. The website also lacks in visual
            aesthetics.
            Most of the functions on the website are presented as links.
            One way to solve the design issues of this website is to create a visible and consistent navigation menu
            that
            will stay throughout the pages of the website. The navigation bar can still be at the upper right corner,
            but
            it should look bigger.
            The website does a great job in providing a good content to help the users develop their coding skills.
            However, the content could be presented in a more effective way with better user interface design choices.
        </p>

        <h2>Hall of Fame</h2>

        <p>I have chosen Codecademy is an online interactive platform that offers free coding classes as an example
            of a good user interface design. In contrast to CodingBat, this website has good visibility and consistency.
            The main navigation menu stays consistent and visible throughout the website. This website provides good
            aesthetics and usability. The use of bright but limited colors makes the user feel more excited to learn
            and presents coding as something fun. The website incorporates a different variety of buttons while still
            following the web design conventions. It uses the design concepts of feedback and errors very well.
            For instance, is a user clicks in the email field without typing anything it prints out an error message
            "can't be blank". Codecademy also follows the core design concept, Hick's Law, by categorizing skills
            choices.
            This website is really good with providing materials and content for acquiring various sets of skills,
            while keeping the content organized. </p>

        <p>Having a good user interface design means helping the users complete their tasks as efficiently and
            effortlessly as possible. For my first project in CS347, I would like to create a website for
            a restaurant. I seek to follow the recommended design principles, while still trying to put my own
            creativity into building the website to achieve a good feedback on my user interface design.
